-Restaurant recommendations based on proximity, weather, and ratings 
  -Restaurant API, Weather API, Google Maps API, Third party identification A web application that can recommend restaurants based on the weather. Taking into account the proximity of the restaurants as well as the rating of the restaurant, the web application will recommend a restaurant with a menu most suitable for that weather. It will use a Weather API , a Restaurant API, as well as Google maps for the location. While the weather API will provide information on temperature and forecast, we will pull key terms and ratings from the restaurant API to access both ratings. This will then allow us to display a list of top suggestions for restaurants.
