We used Flask as one of our technology stacks because we decided to do our code in Python and Flask provides us with a variety of choices when developing the app. 
It is simple and lets us have more control over which components to use; we can also decide how to implement things in Flask. 
It is also a lightweight framework and has little dependency to update. It is also highly secure and easy to deploy. 
The other technology stack we used was HTML because it is lightweight and fast to load. It also has loose syntax so it is very flexible to write in. 
It is easy to edit and HTML is also supported by every browser.
