Focus: Ability to change distance other than recommended distance 
Users will have the ability to edit the distance for the recommended restaurants they want to see. By default, a suggested distance will be given depending on how the weather is (ie. If it is raining, the distance will be shorter). 

Exception 1: Invalid distance entered
If the user enters a negative distance or a distance that is too short/too far and does not permit restaurants to properly show up, an error message will be displayed telling them to reset their distance or to choose the default suggested distance.

Exception 2: Multiple Weather Patterns within a distance
While our application gives suggestions based on weather, if the distance is set too big, there may be different weather conditions within that area causing a conflict in what types of restaurants to display. Therefore, we will pick the area within the distance with the best weather and prioritize those restaurants.
